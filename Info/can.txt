#CAN BUS PROTOCOL ERRORS

Bit error - 	node which is sending a bit on the bus also monitors the bus. The node must detect, and interpret
			as a Bit error, the situation where the bit value monitored is different from the bit value being sent.
				An exception to this is the sending of a recessive bit during the stuffed bit-stream of the Arbitration
			field or during the ACK Slot; in this case no Bit error occurs when a dominant bit is monitored.
				A transmitter sending a PASSIVE Error flag and detecting a dominant bit does not interpret this as
			a Bit error.

Stuff error- 	A Stuff error must be detected and interpreted as such at the bit time of the sixth consecutive equal
			bit level (6 consecutive dominant or 6 consecutive recessive levels), in a message field which
			should be coded by the method of bit stuffing.

CRC error - 	CRC of the reciever is not equal to the transmitter

Form error - 	A FORM error must be detected when a fixed-form bit field contains one or more illegal bits.
	
Acknowledgement error  - An Acknowledgement error must be detected by a transmitter whenever it does not monitor a
dominant bit during ACK Slot

concluzie CAN: errorile pot fi doar HARDWARE( conectica, noise)!!!!
